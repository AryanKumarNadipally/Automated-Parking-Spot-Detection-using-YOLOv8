# Automated-Parking-Spot-Detection-using-YOLOv8

This repository contains a Python-based project that implements a real-time parking spot detection system using the YOLOv8 object detection model and OpenCV. The system is designed to analyze CCTV footage, identify parked vehicles, and monitor the availability of parking spaces in a given area.

## Key Features:

YOLOv8 Integration: Uses the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model for highly accurate vehicle detection.

Robust Performance in Varied Conditions: Efficiently handles footage with shadows and low-light scenarios, such as night vision videos, maintaining high accuracy.

Real-Time Spot Availability: Dynamically counts and displays the number of available parking spots, updating in real-time as vehicles enter or leave.

Efficient Video Processing: Processes frames at a rate of 30 fps, ensuring smooth and timely updates.

Customizable Parking Areas: Features the flexibility to define and modify parking spots within the footage by setting polygonal coordinates.
